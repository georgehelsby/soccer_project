## European Soccer Project
### Learning Pandas Dataframe operations and functions

**This is a project for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.**

I selected a European soccer dataset which contsined information for 11,000+ matches across the top scocer league's in 11 european countries.

My goal was to wrangle the data and explore it in order to come up with some insights regarding the data.

### Question 1: Which are the highest/lowest scoring leagues?

### Question 2: What are the driving factors in a player's overall rating?

### Question 3: Have league trends changed over time?
